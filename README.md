# Data-Structures-And-Algorithms

This repository contains three projects that demonstrate the implementation of various data structures and algorithms in C programming language. Each project focuses on different aspects of data structures and algorithms.

## Project 1: Lists-Stacks-Queues

### Overview

The first project is a student queue management program. It allows users to read student data from a CSV file and perform various operations on the data. The program demonstrates the use of linked lists, dynamic arrays, and stack data structures.

### Features

- Reading Student Data from CSV
- Displaying Student Data
- Adding Students to the Queue
- Random Student Selection
- Queue and Stack Operations
- Execution Time Measurement

### How to Use

1. Compile the program using a C compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to read student data, manage the queue, and perform operations.
4. The program will display the execution time at the end.

## Project 2: Binary-Tree-Coder

### Overview

The second project involves creating a Morse code binary tree coder. It includes the creation of a binary tree structure and coding of characters into Morse code. The program provides functionalities to encode and decode messages using Morse code.

### Features

- Creating a Binary Tree Structure
- Encoding Characters into Morse Code
- Decoding Morse Code into Characters
- User-Friendly Console Interface

### How to Use

1. Compile the program using a C compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Follow the on-screen menu to encode or decode messages in Morse code.

### Note

The program uses a binary tree structure to map characters to Morse code symbols, making it efficient for encoding and decoding messages.

## Project 3: Sorting Algorithms

### Overview

The third project focuses on implementing various sorting algorithms in C. It includes Shell Sort, Heap Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bubble Sort algorithms. The program demonstrates different sorting techniques and measures their execution times.

### Features

- Shell Sort Algorithm
- Heap Sort Algorithm
- Insertion Sort Algorithm (By Publication and Issue Date)
- Bubble Sort Algorithm (By Publication and Issue Date)
- Execution Time Measurement

### How to Use

1. Compile the program using a C compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Select the sorting algorithm you want to use from the menu.
4. The program will display the execution time for the chosen sorting algorithm.

## Conclusion

These three projects collectively demonstrate the implementation of data structures like linked lists, dynamic arrays, binary trees, stacks, and queues, as well as algorithms such as sorting algorithms and Morse code encoding/decoding. Feel free to explore and use these projects as educational resources or for practical applications.

Enjoy learning and coding with these projects!
